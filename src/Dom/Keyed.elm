module Dom.Keyed exposing
  ( container, node )

{-| Support for the VirtualDom `keyedNode` optimization

From the *elm-lang/html* documentation:

> A keyed node helps optimize cases where children are getting added, moved,
> removed, etc. Common examples include:
>
>  - The user can delete items from a list.
>  - The user can create new items in a list.
>  - You can sort a list based on name or date or whatever.
>
> When you use a keyed node, every child is paired with a string identifier. This
> makes it possible for the underlying diffing algorithm to reuse nodes more
> efficiently."

{-| Construct a container element where the child nodes are keyed with unique
identifiers in order to optimize updates to the Dom; the first argument gives
the tag, the second argument is a boolean indicating whether the `lazy`
optimization should also be applied to the keyed children, and the third
argument is a list of keyed element records.
